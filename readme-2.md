#### DevOps Lifecycle Stages
- Continuous Development
- Continuous Testing
- Continuous Integration
  - CI is the practice of merging all developers working copies to a shared mainline several times a day
    - Development
    - Testing
    - Integration
- Continuous Delivery/Deployment
  - CDE (continuous delivery) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, doing so manually
  - CD (Continuous Deployment ) is a software release process that uses automated testing to validate if changes to a codebase are correct and stable for immediate autonomous deployment to a production environment.
- Continous Operations

#### Why CI/CD matters
- Reduce costs
- Faster release rate
- Smaller code changes
- Fault isolations
- More test reliabilty
- Increase team transparency and accountability
- Easy maintenance and updates
